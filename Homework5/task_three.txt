Farewell to me, my mother,
I'm dying, I'm dying!
Sick grief in the chest keeping,
Don't cry for me.
I could not live among people
Cold poison in my soul.
And what he lived and what he loved,
I poisoned myself insanely.
With my proud soul
I passed by happiness.
I saw the spilled blood
And cursed faith and love.
